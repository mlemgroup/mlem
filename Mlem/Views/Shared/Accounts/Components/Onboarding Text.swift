    """
    Lemmy is a social media platform where content is organized into topical forums (communities) \
    and sorted by user votes. It's federated, which means that, instead of a single corporation hosting \
    all the content on a single server, it's instead hosted by a network of independently operated servers called **instances**.

    You make an account on one instance, and it lets you view and interact with content from every other instance \
    that your home instance federates with.
    """

let aboutLemmy: String =
    """
    Lemmy, like Mlem, is a free and open source project. There's no corporate interest behind it; \
    it's a donation-driven project built and run by and for the users to create a platform that can't \
    be destroyed or manipulated on the whim of a small ownership group.

    Lemmy is a link aggregator: it is organized into user-moderated communities where people can post \
    links, pictures, and plain text, and discuss them in a threaded comments section. You can subscribe \
    to communities that fit your interests to create a custom feed of just the content that matters to you.
    """

let aboutInstances: String =
    """
    Instances are independently owned and operated servers running the Lemmy software. Anybody can run \
    an instance, which means that if an instance admin starts abusing their power, you can just hop to a \
    new instance or even make your own.
    
    Instances can choose to federate with other instances, allowing the users of one instance to view and \
    interact with content from any of the federated instances as if it were hosted on their home instance. \
    If this seems strange, just think of it like email: even though alice@abc.com has an email address from \
    one provider and bob@xyz.net has an email from another, they can still send emails to each other because \
    their providers are using a common communication standard.
    """

let pickInstance: String =
    """
    Pick an instance to sign up with. Don't overthink itâ€”the whole point of federation is that you'll see the \
    same content on any federated instance, so just pick one you like and jump right in!
    """
