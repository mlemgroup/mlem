Before you proceed, please carefully read the following Terms of Service ("Terms") governing your use of our app. By accessing or using Mlem, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please refrain from using Mlem.

## 1. User Responsibilities

1.1 Reporting Content: Questionable content or content in violation of the rules and guidelines of the Lemmy instance or community on which it is hosted can be reported to the Lemmy community moderators using Mlem's built-in report function or on the instance website. We are not responsible for moderating or enforcing Lemmy instance or community rules.

1.2 Blocking Users and Instances: Mlem provides you with the ability to block individual users, communities, or entire instances. We encourage you to use these blocking features to create a safe and enjoyable Mlem experience.

1.3 Following Instance Rules: You are required to follow the rules of the instance(s) that you access using Mlem. Instance terms of use can be found on the instance website. Failure to comply with the rules of an instance may result in suspension or termination of your account with that instance as dictated by the instance rules.

1.4 No Misuse: The misuse of Mlem will result in termination of all services--to the furthest of our ability--with us. We reserve the right to terminate--to the furthest of our ability--any services that we provide.

1.5 Adult Content: Some Lemmy instances that Mlem accesses may host adult content. Lemmy blocks this content by default; if you wish to view it, in-app or otherwise, you can enable the option on the website of the instance where your account is registered. We take reasonable measures to prevent the display of explicit or adult content within Mlem, but we cannot guarantee that all instances or communities will follow the appropriate procedures to label adult content as such. It is your responsibility to exercise caution while accessing external content.

1.6 No Abusive, Unlawful, or Offensive Content: You may not use Mlem to produce or distribute any abusive, unlawful, or offensive content. This includes, but is not limited to: content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, or tortious; harmful, threatening, abusive, invasive, or harassing; or hateful or racially, ethnically, or otherwise discriminatory. The content you produce will not harm minors in any way. You will not impersonate any person or entity. You will not upload or post any content that you do not have the right to make available under any US or foreign laws. You will not produce content that interferes with or disrupts the app, the Lemmy instances that you use, other Lemmy instances, or any other service or person. You will not transmit misinformation in any capacity to any individual.

## 2. Limitation of Liability

2.1 No Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim any liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your use of Mlem or any interactions within the Lemmy instances that you access thereby. This includes, but is not limited to, any damages resulting from the content, actions, or conduct of other Mlem or Lemmy users.

## 3. General Provisions

3.1 Modifications: We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate Mlem or these Terms, at our sole discretion, at any time and without prior notice. Your continued use of Mlem after any modifications to these Terms shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Terms.

3.2 Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
